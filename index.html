    <p>President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to run a mass deportation campaign to expel immigrants living in the United States without legal permission. Experts warn that his plan would be disastrous for business.</p>

    <p>“Undocumented immigrants play a massive role in the economy, especially in some industries that if there were to be some sort of mass deportation campaign, we would see the impact on all of us, regardless of our immigration status,” said Mario Carrillo, who directs campaigns at America’s Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates for immigration reform.</p>

    <p>On Dec. 4, America’s Voice <a href="https://americasvoice.org/press_releases/growing-concern-among-business-and-industry-leaders-about-impact-of-mass-deportations/" target="_blank">published a statement</a> warning that mass deportation would “harm every American” by “spiking inflation, driving up deficits, cutting tax revenues, cutting consumer demand, wreaking havoc on a host of industries, and shrinking GDP and employment alike.”</p>

    <p>The statement quotes numerous industry and business leaders who have shared similar concerns.</p>

    <p>Texas, where Carrillo is based, was the state with the second-highest percentage of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce in 2022, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center estimate</a>, at 8.1%. In Nevada, that percentage is 8.6%.</p>

    <p>Following Nevada and Texas, the states with the highest percentage of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce are Florida, New Jersey and California, according to the study.</p>

</script>
</p>

    <p>Instead of deporting immigrants en masse, Carrillo and his organization believe that “expanding legal pathways for folks who are both in the country now and have been here for a long time, and giving them an option to legalize their status” would be better for the country, he said.</p>

    <p>“We also are under no illusions,” Carrillo added. “Under this administration, it is going to be much more challenging to do that.”</p>
